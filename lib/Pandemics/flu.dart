Newspapers were free to report the effects of the epidemic in neutral Spain, such as the grave illness of King Alfonso XIII, and these stories created a false impression of Spain as especially hard hit. This gave rise to the name Spanish flu. Historical and epidemiological data are inadequate to identify with certainty the geographic origin of the pandemic, with varying views as to its location.',
